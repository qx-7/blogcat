Hello there!

Welcome to my lovely little blog.

I decided to make this blog in order to provide myself an outlet for whatever I've been thinking about and things that I'm excited to share with someone. I sometimes get strong urges to create stuff, and this blog is my attempt at remedying those urges by actually *creating* something for once.

I don't think I'll have much for structured content on here. I figure I'll just write whatever comes into my head, sort of like how I would say it aloud. This blog will be my online stream of consciousness; I want this to be a sort of conversation between me and you, where I can just talk about whatever I feel like talking about at the moment. I'm excited to see where this will take me.

Feel free to read the latest posts on the [home page](/) or browse around the [archive](/archive/) for older posts, or you can [search](/search/) for something in particular.

Many thanks for having dropped by! I hope you'll stick with me as this site grows.

Have a great day <3
