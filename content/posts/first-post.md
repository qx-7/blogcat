Hey! So this is my first ever post as blogcat!

It took me several hours to get this blog thing online, from getting the domain name to setting up the website generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to work with my static webhost and get it all working with GitHub... It was a mess, and there's still a way to go with optimizing it, but it's good enough now, and it's just past 1 am now.

I'm so happy that it's finally all working (I hope) and online. This is so much easier to use than writing everything in HTML myself, and so much easier to go back and edit or change the format of. I can't wait to make use of this new platform for personal expression :)

I would love to go ahead and write about something interesting now, except for the fact that it's really late and I can hardly keep my eyes open, let alone think coherently. Tomorrow though for sure, I think.

Thanks for tuning in to this (admittedly uneventful) installment of blogcat. I hope you'll pop back in from time to time.

Sleep tight,

blogcat <3
