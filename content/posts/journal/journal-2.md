Heyyoo, blogcat here. Been a while, crocodile.

As of Wednesday last week, I'm officially back in class. It's already pretty overwhelming, but I think that a lot of the anxiety it's causing me is due to it being new for me and my not having a proper schedule and plan in place. Once I get back in the swing of things, I'm expecting it to at least *feel* a bit easier, even if the workload increases. So much of the work I've been doing lately has just been organizing assignments and schedules and preparing to-do lists and figuring out how to do classes.

Well anyway, nobody wants to read about that, and I don't really want to write about it. Our next topic shall be "good enough", which I suppose sort of applies to class anyway.

One of the main things that I've noticed about visiting friends' houses and such is that most people have different standards than I do, such as for cleanliness and clutter, or for functionality of household objects and such. Personally, I don't mind much clutter, as long as it's mostly sanitary clutter. I can't stand having a grimy floor, but it's fine if half of said floor is covered in, say, books. Also, I generally like to have objects operate properly and expectedly, like having a doorknob that simply turns to open the door, or a lamp that doesn't need any special knowledge or technique to operate.

However, many people that I've visited have different ideas of what is and is not acceptable. Some people absolutely detest clutter, but don't mind a bit of griminess. Some people neglect perfect functionality of things, such as having something that needs a little trick to get it to work.

As a general rule, I would probably be driven to insanity if I had to live with these people. There's nothing wrong with them or anything and I enjoy visiting... you know what I mean. I think it might be a matter of having different expectations and assumptions due to different upbringings. Like I might expect people to eat with their elbows off the table, but some people might never have been told to do so by their parents growing up. I find that people eating with their lips not together really offend me (!) as much as one can be offended by something like that. Similarly, I was never taught to excuse myself after yawning, or to cover my mouth while doing so, which might cause similar reactions in others who *were* taught to do such things.

Back to the class thing, which I still don't want to write about, I think that it's kinda funny how I managed to find the time to write this entry *now*, while I'm the busiest that I've been in months. It's like now that my free time is so much more scarce, I'm really trying to devote some of it to these things that I really seem to enjoy doing, but that might not be my first choice when presented with the plethora of today's entertainment options. YouTube usually seems to nab my attention with that whole "oh you can watch me, I'm only a few minutes long, and you need a break anyway" shtick it's got going on. If it tries to get you with that trick, don't be fooled! There are always, and **always**, more potentially interesting videos to watch immediately after that first one, and the second one, and also the third one. Oh, and the fourth. You get the idea.

It makes sense that YouTube would try to get viewers to stick around, but it's pretty damaging for the people that produce its income, ie. the viewers. Netflix and other, more structured, streaming services don't have the same incentive to keep viewers active, since they make the same amount of money regardless of if I watch 3 or 15 hours of *ATLA* this weekend. And I find that it's also easier to plan to stop watching Netflix when I know that each episode (or movie) takes approximately X minutes to run. YouTube doesn't really do that, and it quickly spirals out of my control, and I almost always regret spending (read: wasting) so much time on the platform.

Don't get me wrong, I think YouTube is a great service. I just think that the video suggestion algorithms that are used should be designed with viewer health in mind, rather than advertiser revenue.

Of course, the best way to remove all possibility of falling into the YouTube pit of brimstone and sorrow is to remove all possibility of *looking at* the YouTube pit of brimstone and sorrow. That is, block the website with a browser extension, or delete the app, or at least put a time limit on it, so that using the app involves conscious thought on how best to spend your limited time with it, hopefully leading to better enjoyment.

How did I even get to that? Maybe this is what those early essayists were talking about. In fact, the word 'essay' comes from the French word meaning "to write," and I think that the best essays (at least to write) are the ones that involve sitting down and just writing. It provides a good stream for the brain to spew out whatever it's currently thinking about.

And boy, do I ever have a lot on my mind! I think I'll wrap up this entry now though. I'm getting really sleepy and I don't want to mess up my sleep schedule too much on a weekend, even if I get Monday off.

It'll all be worth it in the end,
