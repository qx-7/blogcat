[{"content":"Heyyoo, blogcat here. Been a while, crocodile.\nAs of Wednesday last week, I\u0026rsquo;m officially back in class. It\u0026rsquo;s already pretty overwhelming, but I think that a lot of the anxiety it\u0026rsquo;s causing me is due to it being new for me and my not having a proper schedule and plan in place. Once I get back in the swing of things, I\u0026rsquo;m expecting it to at least feel a bit easier, even if the workload increases. So much of the work I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing lately has just been organizing assignments and schedules and preparing to-do lists and figuring out how to do classes.\nWell anyway, nobody wants to read about that, and I don\u0026rsquo;t really want to write about it. Our next topic shall be \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo;, which I suppose sort of applies to class anyway.\nOne of the main things that I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed about visiting friends' houses and such is that most people have different standards than I do, such as for cleanliness and clutter, or for functionality of household objects and such. Personally, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind much clutter, as long as it\u0026rsquo;s mostly sanitary clutter. I can\u0026rsquo;t stand having a grimy floor, but it\u0026rsquo;s fine if half of said floor is covered in, say, books. Also, I generally like to have objects operate properly and expectedly, like having a doorknob that simply turns to open the door, or a lamp that doesn\u0026rsquo;t need any special knowledge or technique to operate.\nHowever, many people that I\u0026rsquo;ve visited have different ideas of what is and is not acceptable. Some people absolutely detest clutter, but don\u0026rsquo;t mind a bit of griminess. Some people neglect perfect functionality of things, such as having something that needs a little trick to get it to work.\nAs a general rule, I would probably be driven to insanity if I had to live with these people. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with them or anything and I enjoy visiting\u0026hellip; you know what I mean. I think it might be a matter of having different expectations and assumptions due to different upbringings. Like I might expect people to eat with their elbows off the table, but some people might never have been told to do so by their parents growing up. I find that people eating with their lips not together really offend me (!) as much as one can be offended by something like that. Similarly, I was never taught to excuse myself after yawning, or to cover my mouth while doing so, which might cause similar reactions in others who were taught to do such things.\n Back to the class thing, which I still don\u0026rsquo;t want to write about, I think that it\u0026rsquo;s kinda funny how I managed to find the time to write this entry now, while I\u0026rsquo;m the busiest that I\u0026rsquo;ve been in months. It\u0026rsquo;s like now that my free time is so much more scarce, I\u0026rsquo;m really trying to devote some of it to these things that I really seem to enjoy doing, but that might not be my first choice when presented with the plethora of today\u0026rsquo;s entertainment options. YouTube usually seems to nab my attention with that whole \u0026ldquo;oh you can watch me, I\u0026rsquo;m only a few minutes long, and you need a break anyway\u0026rdquo; shtick it\u0026rsquo;s got going on. If it tries to get you with that trick, don\u0026rsquo;t be fooled! There are always, and always, more potentially interesting videos to watch immediately after that first one, and the second one, and also the third one. Oh, and the fourth. You get the idea.\nIt makes sense that YouTube would try to get viewers to stick around, but it\u0026rsquo;s pretty damaging for the people that produce its income, ie. the viewers. Netflix and other, more structured, streaming services don\u0026rsquo;t have the same incentive to keep viewers active, since they make the same amount of money regardless of if I watch 3 or 15 hours of ATLA this weekend. And I find that it\u0026rsquo;s also easier to plan to stop watching Netflix when I know that each episode (or movie) takes approximately X minutes to run. YouTube doesn\u0026rsquo;t really do that, and it quickly spirals out of my control, and I almost always regret spending (read: wasting) so much time on the platform.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I think YouTube is a great service. I just think that the video suggestion algorithms that are used should be designed with viewer health in mind, rather than advertiser revenue.\nOf course, the best way to remove all possibility of falling into the YouTube pit of brimstone and sorrow is to remove all possibility of looking at the YouTube pit of brimstone and sorrow. That is, block the website with a browser extension, or delete the app, or at least put a time limit on it, so that using the app involves conscious thought on how best to spend your limited time with it, hopefully leading to better enjoyment.\n How did I even get to that? Maybe this is what those early essayists were talking about. In fact, the word \u0026lsquo;essay\u0026rsquo; comes from the French word meaning \u0026ldquo;to write,\u0026rdquo; and I think that the best essays (at least to write) are the ones that involve sitting down and just writing. It provides a good stream for the brain to spew out whatever it\u0026rsquo;s currently thinking about.\nAnd boy, do I ever have a lot on my mind! I think I\u0026rsquo;ll wrap up this entry now though. I\u0026rsquo;m getting really sleepy and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to mess up my sleep schedule too much on a weekend, even if I get Monday off.\nIt\u0026rsquo;ll all be worth it in the end,\nblogcat \u0026lt;3\n","permalink":"http://blogcat.tk/posts/journal/journal-2/","summary":"Heyyoo, blogcat here.

But first, I do realize that it\u0026rsquo;s been a bit since my first post but it\u0026rsquo;s not because I forgot about this or anything. It\u0026rsquo;s just that there are so many things in my life that are competing for my limited attention, and things that require actual work and effort (like writing stuff) always seem to be left out. Now that my excuse is out of the way, time for the real stuff.\nIn all honesty, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been all that happy lately. The pandemic is really starting to degrade my mental health, but now that summer is around the corner, I should be able to recover a bit. Also, I should hopefully be able to get my vaccine in the next month ish, or at least the first dose. I don\u0026rsquo;t know when the second would become available to me, but one is better than none. And then I\u0026rsquo;ll be more eager to spend some time with people (outside, probably, unless infection rates go way down) without the need to feel constant stress!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been feeling so stressed lately. I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to be able to forget some of that stress. In a few weeks I should be under much less stress and such, but until then, I probably won\u0026rsquo;t be enjoying myself very much at all.\nAs I write this, it\u0026rsquo;s about 1 in the morning on a Sunday. Still feels like Saturday though, since I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet reset my internal clock for the new day. So I guess I\u0026rsquo;m living in tomorrow? I really have a thing for in-between situations like this, where it\u0026rsquo;s not Saturday, but it\u0026rsquo;s not really Sunday yet either. The word for this concept is liminality and it\u0026rsquo;s a source of endless fascination for me.\nI swear I had something super interesting to write about next, but I completely forget what it was. I guess that\u0026rsquo;s what I get for doing this in the early morning\u0026hellip; Though my brain at this time is much more willing to open up about stuff, like the lack of sleep is eroding its filters and safeguards. Out of all the \u0026ldquo;deep\u0026rdquo; conversations I\u0026rsquo;ve had with people, the vast majority have taken place after the sun has set and my filters have gone away. This ties back in to that liminality idea from before. The sun provides daylight and the setting of the sun means the day has ended. However, the next day will not begin until the sun rises again tomorrow morning, and until then, the world exists in a state of liminality between two days.\nI feel like this concept also applies to the past year ish. COVID sort of really hit here in around mid-March of last year, and from that point onward, I\u0026rsquo;ve been staying home for a large portion of my time and not interacting with people like I did before. I haven\u0026rsquo;t had any significant experiences to use as landmarks in my memory in the past year; my memory of the previous twelve months is a total blur.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s the next thing causing me some stress. This is my last real year of being a kid before I go off to my higher education and pursue an adult life, yet I haven\u0026rsquo;t got anything to remember my final time as a high school kid, or even just as a kid in general. For most of my childhood, I\u0026rsquo;ve been pretty well-behaved and such, keeping in line and doing what\u0026rsquo;s expected of me. I always tried to be mature and wise, and I think I succeeded to some degree. However, I sort of missed out on lots of those experiences that really define childhood for lots of people, particularly doing spontaneous and/or forbidden things with people.\nBut then last year (before the pandemic hit) I started to realize that I actually wanted to do some of those stereotypical kid things, to just forget about being the responsible and mature person and do some random whatever for a bit. I don\u0026rsquo;t even want to do much of that, just enough to have some warm memories to look back on in a few years. I want to go out after dark and wander around at midnight, to hang out with people and literally do nothing for hours, to just do something because I want to do it in the moment without first planning it out with all its pros and cons. Of course, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t really do much about that due to the ongoing pandemic and my sense of duty and responsibility to my community.\nThis has left me pretty upset and frustrated, especially since there are many people that do not share my attitude and insist on continuing with their usual hangouts and gatherings, despite the risks associated with those activities. These people make me very upset, as they are causing the pandemic to persist for much longer and at a more serious rate than it would be if everyone took precautions to limit the spread of the infection. But I can\u0026rsquo;t easily demonize all of these people either, since I see so many relatable traits in them and their motivations for continuing to have physical contact with others. It seems so great and nice to be able to allow oneself to do that, and sometimes I really wish I didn\u0026rsquo;t care nearly as much as I do so that I could keep hanging out with people too.\nI just really hope that I can get vaccinated soon so that I won\u0026rsquo;t be as paranoid about airflow and hygiene all the time. And it seems like a dream to even consider going back to \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; as it was before 2020 ruined everyone\u0026rsquo;s lives.\n It\u0026rsquo;s 1:30 am now and I\u0026rsquo;m starting to have some actual difficulty keeping a train of thought going for longer than fifteen seconds, so I think it\u0026rsquo;s time to wrap it up.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t think that I would be able to write so much in my first real substantive post, and I am pleasantly surprised. Sometimes I can get into a groove and just write what I\u0026rsquo;m thinking, and it\u0026rsquo;s great when that happens.\nAnyway, that was the first journal. I could probably go for hours on all this stuff that\u0026rsquo;s been swimming around in my head for a while, and I plan to in future journal entries. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll even put in the time and effort to putting together my scattered ideas from these journals into some sort of cohesive essays or something. Knowing me, I doubt it, but maybe if I get that urge to create something I\u0026rsquo;ll do that.\nAlso, Porter Robinson\u0026rsquo;s new album Nurture is quite good, check it out. I\u0026rsquo;ve been listening to it while writing this and I love it.\nWe can make it together,\nblogcat \u0026lt;3\n","permalink":"http://blogcat.tk/posts/journal/journal-1/","summary":"Alrighty then, I guess it\u0026rsquo;s journal time!

So this is my first ever post as blogcat!\nIt took me several hours to get this blog thing online, from getting the domain name to setting up the website generator Hugo to work with my static webhost and get it all working with GitHub\u0026hellip; It was a mess, and there\u0026rsquo;s still a way to go with optimizing it, but it\u0026rsquo;s good enough now, and it\u0026rsquo;s just past 1 am now.\nI\u0026rsquo;m so happy that it\u0026rsquo;s finally all working (I hope) and online. This is so much easier to use than writing everything in HTML myself, and so much easier to go back and edit or change the format of. I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to make use of this new platform for personal expression :)\nI would love to go ahead and write about something interesting now, except for the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s really late and I can hardly keep my eyes open, let alone think coherently. Tomorrow though for sure, I think.\nThanks for tuning in to this (admittedly uneventful) installment of blogcat.
