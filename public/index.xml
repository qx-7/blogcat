      <description>Heyyoo, blogcat here. Been a while, crocodile.
As of Wednesday last week, I&amp;rsquo;m officially back in class. It&amp;rsquo;s already pretty overwhelming, but I think that a lot of the anxiety it&amp;rsquo;s causing me is due to it being new for me and my not having a proper schedule and plan in place. Once I get back in the swing of things, I&amp;rsquo;m expecting it to at least feel a bit easier, even if the workload increases.</description>

      <description>Alrighty then, I guess it&amp;rsquo;s journal time! But first, I do realize that it&amp;rsquo;s been a bit since my first post but it&amp;rsquo;s not because I forgot about this or anything. It&amp;rsquo;s just that there are so many things in my life that are competing for my limited attention, and things that require actual work and effort (like writing stuff) always seem to be left out. Now that my excuse is out of the way, time for the real stuff.</description>

      <description>Hey! So this is my first ever post as blogcat!
It took me several hours to get this blog thing online, from getting the domain name to setting up the website generator Hugo to work with my static webhost and get it all working with GitHub&amp;hellip; It was a mess, and there&amp;rsquo;s still a way to go with optimizing it, but it&amp;rsquo;s good enough now, and it&amp;rsquo;s just past 1 am now.</description>

      <description>Hello there!
Welcome to my lovely little blog.
I decided to make this blog in order to provide myself an outlet for whatever I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about and things that I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share with someone. I sometimes get strong urges to create stuff, and this blog is my attempt at remedying those urges by actually creating something for once.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll have much for structured content on here.</description>
