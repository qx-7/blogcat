It’s just that there are so many things in my life that are competing for my limited attention, and things that require actual work and effort (like writing stuff) always seem to be left out. Now that my excuse is out of the way, time for the real stuff.\nIn all honesty, I haven’t been all that happy lately. The pandemic is really starting to degrade my mental health, but now that summer is around the corner, I should be able to recover a bit. Also, I should hopefully be able to get my vaccine in the next month ish, or at least the first dose. I don’t know when the second would become available to me, but one is better than none. And then I’ll be more eager to spend some time with people (outside, probably, unless infection rates go way down) without the need to feel constant stress!\nI’ve been feeling so stressed lately. I can’t wait to be able to forget some of that stress. In a few weeks I should be under much less stress and such, but until then, I probably won’t be enjoying myself very much at all.\nAs I write this, it’s about 1 in the morning on a Sunday. Still feels like Saturday though, since I haven’t yet reset my internal clock for the new day. So I guess I’m living in tomorrow? I really have a thing for in-between situations like this, where it’s not Saturday, but it’s not really Sunday yet either. The word for this concept is liminality and it’s a source of endless fascination for me.\nI swear I had something super interesting to write about next, but I completely forget what it was. I guess that’s what I get for doing this in the early morning… Though my brain at this time is much more willing to open up about stuff, like the lack of sleep is eroding its filters and safeguards. Out of all the “deep” conversations I’ve had with people, the vast majority have taken place after the sun has set and my filters have gone away. This ties back in to that liminality idea from before. The sun provides daylight and the setting of the sun means the day has ended. However, the next day will not begin until the sun rises again tomorrow morning, and until then, the world exists in a state of liminality between two days.\nI feel like this concept also applies to the past year ish. COVID sort of really hit here in around mid-March of last year, and from that point onward, I’ve been staying home for a large portion of my time and not interacting with people like I did before. I haven’t had any significant experiences to use as landmarks in my memory in the past year; my memory of the previous twelve months is a total blur.\nAnd that’s the next thing causing me some stress. This is my last real year of being a kid before I go off to my higher education and pursue an adult life, yet I haven’t got anything to remember my final time as a high school kid, or even just as a kid in general. For most of my childhood, I’ve been pretty well-behaved and such, keeping in line and doing what’s expected of me. I always tried to be mature and wise, and I think I succeeded to some degree. However, I sort of missed out on lots of those experiences that really define childhood for lots of people, particularly doing spontaneous and/or forbidden things with people.\nBut then last year (before the pandemic hit) I started to realize that I actually wanted to do some of those stereotypical kid things, to just forget about being the responsible and mature person and do some random whatever for a bit. I don’t even want to do much of that, just enough to have some warm memories to look back on in a few years. I want to go out after dark and wander around at midnight, to hang out with people and literally do nothing for hours, to just do something because I want to do it in the moment without first planning it out with all its pros and cons. Of course, I couldn’t really do much about that due to the ongoing pandemic and my sense of duty and responsibility to my community.\nThis has left me pretty upset and frustrated, especially since there are many people that do not share my attitude and insist on continuing with their usual hangouts and gatherings, despite the risks associated with those activities. These people make me very upset, as they are causing the pandemic to persist for much longer and at a more serious rate than it would be if everyone took precautions to limit the spread of the infection. But I can’t easily demonize all of these people either, since I see so many relatable traits in them and their motivations for continuing to have physical contact with others. It seems so great and nice to be able to allow oneself to do that, and sometimes I really wish I didn’t care nearly as much as I do so that I could keep hanging out with people too.\nI just really hope that I can get vaccinated soon so that I won’t be as paranoid about airflow and hygiene all the time. And it seems like a dream to even consider going back to “normal” as it was before 2020 ruined everyone’s lives.\n It’s 1:30 am now and I’m starting to have some actual difficulty keeping a train of thought going for longer than fifteen seconds, so I think it’s time to wrap it up.\nI didn’t think that I would be able to write so much in my first real substantive post, and I am pleasantly surprised. Sometimes I can get into a groove and just write what I’m thinking, and it’s great when that happens.\nAnyway, that was the first journal. I could probably go for hours on all this stuff that’s been swimming around in my head for a while, and I plan to in future journal entries. Maybe I’ll even put in the time and effort to putting together my scattered ideas from these journals into some sort of cohesive essays or something. Knowing me, I doubt it, but maybe if I get that urge to create something I’ll do that.\nAlso, Porter Robinson’s new album Nurture is quite good, check it out. I’ve been listening to it while writing this and I love it.\nWe can make it together,\nblogcat ",
